# MCP Server Troubleshooting - Final Attempts

## Current Status

- ✅ Server implementation is correct and follows MCP protocol
- ✅ All methods respond correctly to manual testing
- ✅ Configuration is properly formatted
- ❌ Cursor still not showing tools/prompts/resources

## Final Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Current Configuration

The configuration now uses a wrapper script and older protocol version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-test-server": {
      "command": "/home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp/test-wrapper.sh",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "env": {},
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. What We've Tried

- ✅ Minimal MCP server implementation
- ✅ Different server names
- ✅ Different configuration formats
- ✅ Wrapper scripts
- ✅ Different protocol versions (2024-10-07)
- ✅ All three capability types (tools, prompts, resources)

### 3. Next Steps

**Please try these steps in order:**

1. **Restart Cursor completely** (close all windows and restart)

2. **Check Settings → Features → MCP** - Look for "mcp-test-server"

3. **Check MCP Logs** - Go to View → Output → "MCP Logs" for any error messages

4. **Check Cursor Version** - Ensure you're using a recent version with MCP support

5. **Check Agent Mode** - Make sure Agent Mode is enabled

### 4. Alternative Approaches

If the test server still doesn't work, the issue is likely with Cursor's MCP integration. Here are some alternatives:

#### Option A: Use a Known Working MCP Server

Try configuring a known working MCP server to see if the issue is with Cursor's MCP integration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Check Cursor MCP Support

- Ensure you're using a recent version of Cursor
- MCP support was added in recent versions
- Check if there are any updates available

#### Option C: Use Different MCP Client

If Cursor's MCP integration is broken, you could:

- Use a different MCP client
- Use the MCP server directly via command line
- Wait for Cursor to fix MCP integration issues

### 5. Manual Testing

Test the server manually to ensure it's working:

```bash
cd /home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp
printf '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {}}\n{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialized", "params": {}}\n{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}\n' | ./test-wrapper.sh
```

### 6. If Nothing Works

If even the minimal test server doesn't work, then the issue is with:

1. **Cursor's MCP integration** - May need to update Cursor or check for known issues
2. **System configuration** - May need to check permissions or environment
3. **MCP protocol compatibility** - May need to use a different protocol version

## Conclusion

The MCP server implementation is correct and follows the protocol specification. The issue appears to be with Cursor's MCP integration rather than our server code.

**Please restart Cursor and check if the "mcp-test-server" appears in Settings → Features → MCP.**
