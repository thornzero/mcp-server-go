# MCP Server Debugging Steps

## Current Status

- ✅ Server implementation is correct and follows MCP protocol
- ✅ All methods respond correctly to manual testing
- ✅ Configuration is properly formatted
- ❌ Cursor still not showing tools/prompts/resources

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Test with Minimal Server

I've created a minimal test server (`test-mcp-server`) that only implements the basic MCP protocol. The configuration now only includes this test server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test": {
      "command": "/home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp/test-mcp-server",
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Restart Cursor completely**
2. **Check Settings → Features → MCP** - Look for "test" server
3. **Check if the test server appears** - This will tell us if the issue is with our implementation or Cursor's MCP integration

### 2. Check Cursor Logs

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **View → Output**
3. Select **"MCP Logs"** from the dropdown
4. Look for any error messages related to MCP servers

### 3. Verify Cursor Version

- Ensure you're using a recent version of Cursor
- MCP support was added in recent versions
- Check if there are any updates available

### 4. Check Agent Mode

- Make sure **Agent Mode** is enabled in Cursor
- MCP tools are primarily used in Agent Mode
- Try enabling/disabling Agent Mode

### 5. Test Different Configurations

If the test server doesn't work, try these alternative configurations:

#### Option A: Different server name

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-test": {
      "command": "/home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp/test-mcp-server",
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: With working directory

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test": {
      "command": "/home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp/test-mcp-server",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "cwd": "/home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Manual Testing

Test the server manually to ensure it's working:

```bash
cd /home/thornzero/Repositories/mewling-goat-tavern/mcp
printf '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {}}\n{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialized", "params": {}}\n{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}\n' | ./test-mcp-server
```

Expected output:

```json
{"id":1,"result":{"capabilities":{"tools":{"listChanged":true}},"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","serverInfo":{"name":"test-mcp","version":"1.0.0"}}}
{"id":2,"result":{"tools":[{"description":"A simple test tool","inputSchema":{"properties":{"message":{"description":"Test message","type":"string"}},"type":"object"},"name":"test_tool"}]}}
```

### 7. If Test Server Works

If the minimal test server appears in Cursor, then the issue is with our full implementation. We can then:

1. **Re-enable the full server** with the working configuration
2. **Debug the full server** by comparing it to the working minimal version
3. **Add features incrementally** to identify what's causing the issue

### 8. If Test Server Doesn't Work

If even the minimal test server doesn't appear in Cursor, then the issue is with:

1. **Cursor's MCP integration** - May need to update Cursor or check for known issues
2. **System configuration** - May need to check permissions or environment
3. **MCP protocol version** - May need to use a different protocol version

## Current Test Configuration

The configuration is now simplified to only include the test server. This will help isolate whether the issue is with our implementation or with Cursor's MCP integration.

**Please restart Cursor and check if the "test" server appears in Settings → Features → MCP.**
