# Code Style Guidelines

## File Headers

- Code must start with path/filename as a one-line comment
- Example: `// /home/thornzero/Repositories/mcp-server-go/internal/server/server.go`

## Comments

- Comments should describe purpose, not effect
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Document complex business logic

## Code Organization

- Prioritize modularity, DRY principles, and performance
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes
- Group related functionality into packages
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Go-Specific

- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use context for cancellation and timeouts
- Follow Go idioms and conventions
